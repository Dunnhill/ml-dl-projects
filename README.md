# Projects

* [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/Dunnhill/ml-dl-projects/tree/master/Neural%20Style%20Transfer)

## Neural Style Transfer

* Used framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

* To focus only on the style of the output image, *the content image* is always selected as *the input image*. If desired, you can use white noise.

* Used CNN: [VGG-19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

* Code of the usial style transfer mostly taken from the seminar of [Deep Learning School](https://www.dlschool.org/) (spring, 2020)

* All calculations was made using [Colaboratory Google (Colab) ](https://colab.research.google.com/)
